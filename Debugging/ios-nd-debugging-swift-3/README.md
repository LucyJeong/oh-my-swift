# iOS Debugging

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains resources for Udacity's iOS Debugging course.

## Overview

iOS Debugging covers the basics of print or "caveman" debugging, debugging with breakpoints, and the new visual debugging tools provided by Xcode. It uses a single, flowing example called SoManyBugs to demonstrate each debugging technique.

## Setup

The SoManyBugs should build and run without any additional setup; however, it is purposefully riddled with runtime bugs that should be solved as you complete the iOS Debugging course.
